# odin-recipes

This is the first project in the Foundations path of The Odin Project.

This project will present a homepage that organizes and links to some recipes.
I will demonstrate my knowledge of HTML, Git, and the importance of writing meaningful commits. In the future, CSS will be added to enhance the project.
