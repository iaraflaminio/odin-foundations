        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Gazpacho is a classic cold soup originating from Spain, known for its refreshing taste and vibrant colors.
            Made from ripe tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, onions, and a touch of garlic, this dish is blended with
            extra-virgin olive oil and sherry vinegar to create a smooth and tangy flavor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Traditionally served chilled, gazpacho is perfect for hot summer days and can be garnished with reserved
            vegetables for added texture and presentation. The balance of fresh ingredients and simple preparation makes
            gazpacho a delicious and healthy option, ideal for light meals or as a starter.
